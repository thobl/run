    """Add a new experiment.

    Based on the experiment description, a set of inidvidual runs is
    generated, where each individual run basically corresponds to a
    set of command line arguments.  The arguments are represented by a
    dictionary, i.e., each argument has a key and a value.

    To describe how the arguments of an individual run can be used in
    several places, we need the concept of a *blob*.  Ultimately, a
    blob is something that will be evaluated to a string by replacing
    wildcards of the form ``[[key]]`` with the value of the
    corresponding argument.  A blob can also be a function, in which
    case it is evaluated (with the arguments as parameter) before
    doing this kind of replacements.  For more details on how a blob
    turns into a string, see the function ``deblob()``.  Note that a
    blob is only defined in the context of an individual run.  Thus,
    whenever we talk about blob, we implicitly have an individual run
    with a specific set of arguments in mind.

    Parameters
    ----------

    name: blob

      Name of the experiment.  An experiment is only run if its name
      (or the name of its ``group``) appears as command line parameter.
      It does not need to be unique among experiments.

    command: blob

      The command that will be called for each run.

    arguments_descr: dictionary

      Dictionary of arguments or lists of arguments.  In case of
      lists, one run for each combination of arguments is generated.
      Each individual argument is a blob, where the blobs are
      evaluated to strings in order of appearance in the dictionary.

    creates_file: blob, optional

      Describes the name of a file that is created by calling the
      command.  This is only used to skip the run if the file already
      exists (at the time when this method is called, not at the time
      when the command is actually run).

    stdout_file: blob, optional

      The filename to which the standard output of the run should be
      written.  There are three different cases, depending on whether
      this file already exists:

      1. If the file exists when calling this function (i.e., before
         performing any runs), the run is skipped.

      1. If the run is not skipped but the file exists when executing
         the run, the standard output is added at the end of the file.

      1. If the file does not exist, it is created beginning with the
         header (if specified) and then the standard output is added.

    stdout_mod: function, default =``identity``

      A function applied to the standard output of the run, before
      writing it to the file.  If the function takes one argument, it
      gets the standard output as string as input.  Otherwise, it
      should take two arguments, the standard output as string and the
      result of a call to ``subprocess.run()``.  The latter gives
      access to additional information such as the return code.  The
      function can return a blob using the special wildcard
      ``[[stdout]]`` (similar to ``stdout_res``).

    stdout_res: blob, optional

      If given, this blob is written to the file instead of the
      standard output itself.  This blob is somewhat special in the
      sense that it evaluated after the run has finished with the
      special argument ``stdout``, i.e., the blob can contain the
      special wildcard ``[[stdout]]``, which will be replaced by the
      standard output (after it was modified by ``stdout_mod``).

    header_string: blob, optional

      A string specifying the header; see input parameter
      ``stdout_file``.

    header_command: blob, optional

      A command that is run to use its standard output as header.

    header_mod: function, default =``identity``

      A function that is applied to the header (specified by
      ``header_string`` or ``header_command``) before writing it to a
      file.  It should take one argument (a string) and return a
      string.

    return_string: blob, optional

      If given, this blob will be evaluated for each run and a list of
      the results is returned.

    allowed_return_codes: list[int], default =``[0]``

      A list of allowed return codes.  If a command returns any other
      code, a warning is printed and the run is aborted.  The empty
      list ``[]`` indicates that any return code should be accepted.

    combinations_filter: function, default = always ``True``

      A function that filters the combinations of arguments.  It
      should take a dictionary of arguments and decide whether it
      represents a valid combination by returning ``True`` of
      ``False``.  The default returns always ``True``, i.e., a run is
      created for every combination.

    Returns
    -------
    None or list[string]
        See documentation of ``return_string``.
